# Starting a new feature
every time i want to start working on a new idea, this is teh worlflow ill use
- `git checkout main`
    - switch to looking at the source code aka main branch 
- `git pull`
    -downloads the source code 
- `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
    - this creates a new branch off of the main branch called my-branch-name
- write code until you are ready to create a pull request
    `git status`
    `git add my-filename.txt
         (example) git add README 
    `git commit -m "Describe save file" `
    while we code on our new branch we want to incrementally save our progress until we are ready to make a pull request, we do that by making commits
-   ` git push `
    - new save file that we want to merge into main by creating a pull request and asking for a code review on github
-   - assign kelly as code reviewer on git hub
-   - once kelly approves merge our pull request into the main branch 
-   - start a new idea by starting at the beginning, from the top of the list



## Helpful commands 
-   `git status (branch name) (files added in)
-   -feeds progress-
    `git add filename`
-   -adds these progress features, (mainly needs to be done or system gets mad at you >:(
    `git branch`
    - tell us branch we are currently on and all the other names of other branches that are available
-   `git diff` 
    -
